# FTestChecklist
Includes proof of concepts for some of my Capstone feasibility tests.

1. Testing an interaction of saving data to a JSON file and also loading data from the same file, which creates a automatic save and load functionality (technical feasability test).
2. Testing an interaction of allowing the user to input. In Unity specifically this includes some different code to allow us to work with the iOS keyboard. (game feasability test).
